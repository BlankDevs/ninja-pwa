# Ninja-pwa
Ninja PWA is a React-based PWA for ordering coffee with Firebase backend. The user is able to log, order coffee, save recipes or view recipes saved by other users (should he/she wish to do so).

The app uses firebase for the backend - the database schema rules have unfortunately so firebase has shut down the app and it's host link. I have however attached screenshots of how it looks on mobile and on web.
